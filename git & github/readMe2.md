# Repositories 
 * usually called 'repos'. store the full history and version control of a project . 
 * the can either be hosted locally or on a shared server , such as Github . 
 * most "repos" are stored on GitHub . while core contributors  make copies of the repository on their machine and update the repository using the push.pull system 
 * any "repos" stored somewhere other than locally is called a "remote repository"

 # Repos VS Directories 
   * repository are timelines of the entire project , including all previous changes 
   * Directories , or "Working Directories" are projects at their current state in tine . 
   * any local directory interacting with a  repository is technically a repository itself , however, it is better to call these directories "local repositories", as they are instances of a remote repository .
