# undefined 
 * Default value if uninitialized variables 
 * you shouldn't assign undefined as a value manually 
 * example 
    - let x ; console.log(x) => undefined
 * typeof undefined => undefined 

# null 
 * Never assumed by default 
 * you can assign this is a value if you want to "reset" / "clear" a variable 
 - null == undefined => true 
 - null === undefined => false
* typeof null => Object 

 # NaN ==> Not a Type ! 
  * technically it's of type number and can therefore be used in calculations 
  like ==> 9 * "Hi" ==> the result is NaN 
  * typeof NaN => Number
