# Map 
   * Does Not Contain key by default
   * Key can be anything [Function, Object , Any Primitive Data Types]
   * Ordered By Insertion 
   * Get items By Size 
   * Can be directly Iterated 
   * Better Performance when add or remove data 
# Object
   * Has Default key 
   * key can be String or Symbol 
   * Not 100% Till Now 
   * Need To DO Manually 
   * Not Directly and need to use object.keys() and  and so on 
   * Low performance when comparing TO Map
